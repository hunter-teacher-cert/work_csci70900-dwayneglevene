//your setup function runs your function only one time
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}
// the draw function repeats your code in continous loop
function draw() {
  background(220);
  
  //Your looking at an if statement with a conditional
  //this conditgion is a system variable that p5 created to see if you are pressing a key
  
//think of your favorite video games like fortnite or 2k you can control your player by pressing buttons  this is how you do it
  if(keyIsPressed){
    //nested conditional checks if the key is g only if your key is pressed
    if(key == 'y'){
      background('black')
    }
    
    
    
  }
