## Lesson plan

Aim: Students will use print,data types and concatentation to construct a statement.

Do now: Look at the following lines of code:
    String month = "May";
    System.out.println("My birthday is in " + month);

What do you think they do?

Students who had JS before may ask why is the data type before the variable?
Some students may look at the keyword print and say it prints My birthday is in May.

Run the code after students take educated guesses.

Mini lesson:

Unline JS Java syntax is a bit different.The computer doesnt automatically know your data type, you have to state it in your declarations.
As I did in the do now; I stated that the data type of the variable month was a String

There are also others such as:

int for integer, 
boolean to test true or false,
double for decimal value ex: 0.0,2.3

Also I want to show you how I printed the statement
Instead of console.log we use 
System.out.println (*Prints on different line) 
System.out.print( *PRints on same line)

Within the statement I added text to my variable value with a plus sign to make a new sentence this is known as concatenation.

Activity:
Lets use what we have just discussed in a lab that asks us to print out dates and times

Allow students to work for 15 to 20 minutes

Ending:

Shareout What did you all find difficult about the lab?

Go over the lab together with students to make sure they firmly understand data types before moving on to next lesson.
